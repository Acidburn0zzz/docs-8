Q: What are the best practices following the UK guidance related to in-app-purchases? ([4:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsqFC1Y_aX8&t=4m08s))

Q: What is the best way to monetize your game? ([7:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsqFC1Y_aX8&t=7m44s)) [[MonetizingYourOUYAGame.pdf](http://ouya-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/MonetizingYourOUYAGame.pdf)]

Q: What is the best way to get your game through submission? [[Submission Guidelines](https://devs.ouya.tv/developers/docs/content-review-guidelines)]

Q: I am planning on developing a game on OUYA. My only worry is that with developing for any kind of console there will be graphical limitations. My game is no (AAA) graphics but I plan on having quite a few of things on screen at once. (Open sandbox game)? ([9:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsqFC1Y_aX8&t=9m34s))

Q: Have we seen a recent document about best-practices industry-wide related to in-app-purchases? ([12:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsqFC1Y_aX8&t=12m15s))

Q: Are you making a completely free to play game with micro-transactions or are you making a game where you would buy into the full-version of the game? ([13:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsqFC1Y_aX8&t=13m15s))

Q: What are (if there are any) the dependencies for using 3rd party apps that are usable on Android (on the OUYA). I.e. Photon Server, Newgetta, Everplay, can these be used? ([29:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsqFC1Y_aX8&t=29m36s))

Q: Are willing to put the idea fourth for submitting the "Couch Gamer Bundle" (OUYA + 4 controllers) on the various distributors? ([39:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsqFC1Y_aX8&t=39m55s))

Q: Asking for developer feedback: What do developers think about a premium purchase model option for games that wouldn't have a free to play option? ([49:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsqFC1Y_aX8&t=49m57s))

Q: How do we contact you again? (I have completely forgotten???) ([57:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsqFC1Y_aX8&t=57m32s))
